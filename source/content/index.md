Welcome to the ROS 2 Guidelines, created for the Nakama Robotics Lab (but applicable to all ROS 2 projects)!

You can start with the [[ROS 2 Beginner's Guide/index|ROS 2 Beginner's Guide]].

## How is this website created?

You can find the source code on <https://github.com/jellehierck/ros2-guidelines>.

The website contents are created in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and transformed to GitHub Pages using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and the [obsidian-quartz-template](https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/obsidian-quartz-template).
