## Status

  **Not done, priority: low**
    - Useful links are collected, I also have a list of tools that are woth mentioning.
    - This page could probably be fairly short, with links to each tool & only a short description of what it does.
    - Perhaps the most commonly used tools can get command line examples of how to use them.
