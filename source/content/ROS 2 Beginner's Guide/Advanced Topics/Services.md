## Status

**Not done, priority: low**
- Some useful links are collected.
- I have a lot of experience with services now, so I could probably write a lot about them.
- Use cases for people is quite limited: most people can get away with some dumb topic constructions which work fine and are therefore not dumb.
- Important to mention the stuff about executors and how to use callback groups (see [[Executors]])

## What to write about

Services:

Synchronous vs async:

- <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/How-To-Guides/Using-callback-groups.html>
- Give example as implemented in `franka_buttons_ros2`?
