## Status
**Not done, priority: low**
    - Though fundamental to most robot operations, this is probably too advanced for most people.
    - Initial focus should be a baseline understanding of what the robot description is, and how the TF2 library works at the most basic level.
    - Perhaps also list some tools to view robot model & TF2 trees (links to [[Useful Tools]]).
    - Advanced stuff includes how to create & manage robot descriptions and TF2 stuff, but that is very specific and probably only useful to some people.
