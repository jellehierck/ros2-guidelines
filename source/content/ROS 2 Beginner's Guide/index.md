The ROS 2 Beginner's Guide aids you with understanding ROS 2. It was created since we felt like the official documentation is great in some parts, but lacked in others because it was too simplistic, too advanced, or did not get to the point. In addition, we provide some more real-world applicable examples and code snippets to use.
